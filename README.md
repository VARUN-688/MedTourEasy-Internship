# Left-Handedness and Age of Death Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates the phenomenon of left-handedness and its association with the age of death. It utilizes data from a National Geographic survey from 1986 and death distribution data from the United States in 1999. The analysis focuses on whether left-handed individuals die younger than right-handed ones, as suggested by previous studies. By employing Python, pandas, and Bayesian statistics, this project provides insights into the impact of societal changes in the perception of left-handedness over time.

## Datasets
The project uses two key datasets:
1. **Left-Handedness Data**: Rates of left-handedness from a survey published in a 1992 paper by Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki. Available [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1528408).
2. **Death Distribution Data**: Age-specific death counts from the United States in the year 1999, sourced from the CDC. Available [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/vs00199_table310.pdf).

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
